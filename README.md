This individual endeavor originated from a set of personal objectives. Frequent headaches, particularly upon waking, prompted my interest in correlating my daily well-being with weather conditions. 
In pursuit of this personal investigation, I aimed to experiment with APIs, services, and Windows forms. This project successfully amalgamated these goals, providing a platform for exploration and integration of various elements.

This project is divided into two components. Firstly, a compact service runs daily on a Raspberry Pi, making an API call to retrieve and store the day's weather information on a shared NAS. 
The second part comprises a Windows forms application featuring a user interface for accessing and displaying historical weather data. 
Additionally, the application allows inputting a daily well-being score on a scale of 1-10, facilitating future data analysis.
